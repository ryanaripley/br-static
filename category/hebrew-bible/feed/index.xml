<p>Today, we take for granted our ability to have the biblical text at our fingertips &#8211; almost anywhere. According to one&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161016101522/http://www.lifewayresearch.com/2011/04/21/lifeway-research-finds-americans-still-appreciate-kjv/">study</a>, 89% of American households own at least one bible and the average American household owns 4.1 bibles (not even to mention the digital copies we carry in our pockets and backpacks).</p>



<p>This wide-access to the texts of scripture, enjoyed by Americans, is a relatively new phenomenon (post reformation). For most of biblical history and the era of the church the vast majority of people were dependent upon the public recitation or reading of scripture. In other words, scripture was something heard and performed &#8211; listened to- rather than looked at and studied.</p>



<h3>Tom Meyer is trying to resurrect this lost art.</h3>



<p>He performs long portions of the biblical text from memory and in so doing, gives others the opportunity to practice the lost art of listening to the public performance of long portions of scripture. I had the pleasure of discussing this topic &#8211; the orality of scripture &#8211; with Tom last fall. Watch our 15 minute discussion and gain insight into how the ancient practice of&nbsp;<em>hearing</em>&nbsp;scripture can enliven your study of the text.</p>

<h3>Interview Highlights:</h3>



<p>Tom Meyer has memorized over twelve complete books of the biblical text. He is the founder of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thescripturecannotbebroken.com/">The Scripture Cannot Be Broken Ministries</a>&nbsp;and tours the country in association with Wordsower Ministries in order to dramatically perform the biblical text from memory. He also happens to be a professor of Old testament and Bible Memorization at Shasta Bible College in Redding, CA and has two M.A&#8217;s from Jerusalem University College.</p>



<h3>We talked about:</h3>



<ol><li>Why hearing scripture so important for our devotional life?</li><li>​The importance of the spoken word to the bible&#8217;s original audience (both OT and NT audiences)</li><li>The importance of hearing scripture in the wider church.</li><li>What is the difference between reading the bible and and hearing the bible performed?</li><li>Strategies for developing the ancient practice of hearing scripture on a regular basis.</li></ol>

<p>In this eighteen minute video, I talk with author and pastor, Brad Gray about his new book&nbsp;<em>Make Your Mark; Getting Right what Samson got Wrong</em>.</p>



<p>His book takes a new look at the character of Samson from the book of Judges. Using all of the archaeological, cultural and linguistic data available to him, Gray, shows how the writers of Judges meant for us to know a Samson very different than the powerful character we known from Sunday school and popular culture.</p>

<p><em>Apologies for the delayed and overlapping audio. I am not trying to talk over Brad. I am, however, still learning how to do all of this well. The fault is mine, not Brad’s.</em></p>



<p>Brad is a fantastic teaching pastor at Central Wesleyan Church in Holland Michigan. He holds an M.Div. from Western Theological Seminary and studied with me at Jerusalem University College.&nbsp;<em>Make Your Mark</em>&nbsp;aligns so well with the mission of Biblical Remains. Not only does it focus on what the ancient context of the story can tell us about Samson, It also points us towards how we can live better today because of that knowledge.</p>



<p>Brad was kind enough to discuss the following five questions:</p>



<ol><li>How does the Samson the biblical writers intended us to know differ from the Samson we know from Sunday school and popular culture?</li><li>Why is the Samson narrative so important for us today?</li><li>What is your favorite lesson from the life of Samson?</li><li>What insight did you gain that was only possible with the use of linguistic, cultural or archaeological data?</li><li>For someone who is not used to studying the text in this way what tools would you suggest they use to get started?</li></ol>



<h3>You can&nbsp;get your very own copy of&nbsp;<em>Make Your Mark; Getting Right What Samson Got Wrong</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170122004200/http://amzn.to/24aNbTD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a></h3>
